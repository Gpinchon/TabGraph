# TODO List
## To refactor/improve
 - Figure out how to add BSP/Octree system to the new SceneGraph system

## To finish
 - New Renderer system

## To create from ground up
 - [Morph targets][1]
 - PhysicsEngine Interface and Implementation (using [Bullet][2])
 - LightProbes system
 - Assets packing system (via a new file format or gltf ?)
 - Raytraced primitives rendering (blobs/spheres/cubes...)
 - Voxel rendering
 - Mesh instantiation system
 - Templated Octree (that's an easy one)
 - Particle systems
 - Sounds
 - Interface
 - Create an edition tool to create and export scenes
