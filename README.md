# TabGraph
*tabGraph* is a full SceneGraph featuring a flexible Component system, giving a lot of freedom for adding new components to your scene and organizing it.

# Subsystems and their role
```mermaid
flowchart
Assets::Parser --Loads--> Asset
Asset --Stores--> ECS & Objects
Renderer --Renders--> ECS
Game/Project --Edits--> ECS & Objects
Game/Project --Initializes/Triggers--> Assets::Parser & Renderer
```
The [*ECS*](./ECS) system is the foundation of the whole project.
A [*SceneGraph*](./SceneGraph) is generated by the [*Assets*](./Assets) parser or the user using the ECS system
The SceneGraph is then given to the [*Renderer*](./Renderer)
The Game/Project is in charge of managing window, assets and triggering rendering
The common tools for the whole project are located in [*Tools*](./Tools)
Demos and tests are located in [*UnitTests*](./UnitTests)

# Dependencies
Dependencies are automatically fetched using CMake.

This project was made with the will to reduce dependencies to what's strictly necessary:
 - [GLEW][8] for OpenGL because I don't wanna query extensions manually*
 - [STB][11] for image parsing
 - [zlib][3] for FBX parsing
 - [GLM][1] for vectorial math
 - [SDL2][6] for Scene Renderer window system and events
 - [Nlohmann JSON][2] for parsing GLTF
 - [GTest][4] GTest for unit tests
 - [EGL-Registry][5] & [GL-Registry][7] for KTX parsing
 - [GCEM][9] for accelerated Spherical Harmonics calculation
