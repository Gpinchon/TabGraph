Assets::Parser --Loads--> Asset
Asset --Stores--> ECS & Objects
Renderer --Renders--> ECS
Game/Project --Edits--> ECS & Objects
Game/Project --Initializes/Triggers--> Assets::Parser & Renderer
```
The [*ECS*](./ECS) system is the foundation of the whole project.
A [*SceneGraph*](./SceneGraph) is generated by the [*Assets*](./Assets) parser or the user using the ECS system
The SceneGraph is then given to the [*Renderer*](./Renderer)
The Game/Project is in charge of managing window, assets and triggering rendering
The common tools for the whole project are located in [*Tools*](./Tools)
Demos and tests are located in [*UnitTests*](./UnitTests)
